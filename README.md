# Content Creation Framework - Google Sheets ðŸ“—

## Background ðŸ“š
Content creation requires careful planning, collaboration, and tracking. To
streamline the process, I have built a structured *Content Creation
Framework* in Google Sheets. This framework ensures content is
developed, reviewed, published, and analyzed efficiently.


## Introduction ðŸ“¢
This project consists of a *Google Sheets-based content management system*
with two main worksheets:

   1. **Framework** A structured content workflow with essential elements like timeline, content details, CTAs, and performance tracking.
   2. **Team & Roles** =E2=80=93 A detailed breakdown of team members, their roles, and a checklist of their responsibilities.

By using this framework, teams can *organize content production, track
responsibilities, and measure performance* in a single, centralized
document.
